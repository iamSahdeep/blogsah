**What**

Bop is my first android project, actual project not like todo's etc. I have just started learning Android and wanted to make Music Player of my own. So this music player is unique in its own way, cause its only made by me, with amazing UI and supports almost all audio files extension. And automatically searches for them through Media Scanner.

#### **Why**

Well if you just look at the first release it was just simple music player with list of all songs and playlist that are there in media library, but main task was to improve and beautify its UI as well as Its functionality.

First Release :

Last Release :

#### **How**

I won't say it was too easy or difficult for me but yeah i learned alot developing it from Notifications to MediaScanner, Memory leaks, Services, blah blah(other android terms :p)

It was huge for me to cause  a lot of people even did the small contribution in development and financially by donating. Thanks to all of them. :)
