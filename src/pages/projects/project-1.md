#### **What**

So, Liquid Swipe is a Widget made in Flutter using dart. I provided the Swipe to your stacked Containers with Liquidified animation to it. It actually clips the front container and displays the container behind it.

#### **Why**

Was just looking for some cool designs on Dribble and then found this as a design on it. Then looked for the developers and they have only build it for Swift.

Then Started working on it. :p

#### **How**

For a month I was trying to convert the swift code into flutter and was very frustated of it cause i didn't even know about the "S" of the Swift language. Then I come to know about [IntroView](https://github.com/aagarwal1012/IntroViews-Flutter "Introview") and then everything became easy for me.
